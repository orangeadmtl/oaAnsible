## üéØ Component Tags

Use these tags with `universal.yml` for targeted deployments:

| Tag | Description | Roles Included |
|-----|-------------|----------------|
| `base` | Core system setup | Platform base roles |
| `network` | Network configuration | Tailscale, WiFi setup |
| `security` | Security hardening | Permissions, access control |
| `device-api` | Device API deployment | Unified device API |
| `tracker` | AI tracking system | Object tracking runtime |
| `player` | Video player | Media playback service |
| `camguard` | Camera monitoring | MediaMTX streaming |
| `parking-monitor` | Parking detection | Vehicle detection service |
| `ml-workstation` | ML development | GPU, training environment |
| `optimization` | Performance tuning | Server optimizations |

## üöÄ Deployment Examples

### Full Platform Deployment
```bash
# Deploy all components for macOS device
ansible-playbook universal.yml -i inventory/production.yml

# Deploy specific components
ansible-playbook universal.yml -i inventory/staging.yml -t device-api,tracker
```

### ML Workstation Setup
```bash
# Ubuntu ML workstation
ansible-playbook universal.yml -i inventory/ml-servers.yml -t ml-workstation

# macOS ML development
ansible-playbook onboard-ml-macos.yml -i inventory/dev-macs.yml
```

### Platform-Specific Playbooks
```bash
# Platform-specific onboarding
ansible-playbook macos-onboarding.yml -i inventory/new-macs.yml
ansible-playbook ubuntu-onboarding.yml -i inventory/new-servers.yml
ansible-playbook orangepi-onboarding.yml -i inventory/new-pis.yml
```

## üìù Role Development Guidelines

### Common Patterns
- Use `defaults/main.yml` for role variables
- Implement handlers for service management
- Use templates for configuration files
- Follow idempotency principles

### Dependencies
- Platform detection is automatic in `universal.yml`
- Use `meta/main.yml` for role dependencies
- Common roles can be used by platform-specific roles

### Testing
- Test roles with `ansible-playbook --check` (dry run)
- Use `ansible-playbook --diff` to see changes
- Test on staging environment before production
